# regex
Regular expression engine

An attempt at writing a regular expression engine that uses the Thomson NFA approach, mostly for educative reasons.
The code follows Russ Cox's expos√© for the most parts. The machine code compiled is specific to Intel x86_64 on Linux (System V ABI)
The Regex class also allows for visualization of the NFA or DFA by outputting the graphviz DOT format code to represent the graph.
